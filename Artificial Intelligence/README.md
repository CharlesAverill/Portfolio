# CALIPSO Music Genre Classification
CALIPSO - "ClAssifier for Love In addition to Pirate Songs"

CALIPSO is an early project that I worked on, with the goal of classifying songs into one of two categories: "Love" and "Pirate". My band director once jokingly stated that every song fell into one of these categories, and the more I thought about it, the more it made sense. To streamline the classification process, I trained this model.

# CartPole
A tutorial I followed that trains a NN to play a game where the goal is to balance a pole on a cart.

# First CNN
The first CNN I wrote, just categorizes stuff from MNIST.

# Genetic Programming
Very basic genetic stuff, I didn't enjoy the topic so I ceased progress on these.

# Gothic Text Generator
One of my Kaggle datasets. Lots of gothic text, and models to generate new gothic passages.

# INSERTER
My very first handwritten model. I used scikit-learn and the randomforestregressor to predict current solar irradiance based on temperature, humidity, time, etc. Very useful for knowing when to activate your solar panels. The models are too large to upload to Github, so here's a  GDrive link to my first 2: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xTrHogyQ2QVSlFasU4KyXLLxMtebyKvI. v1 takes into account wind direction and speed, which completely throw off the predictions. I recommend using v2, which doesn't have this issue.

# Planes-Cars CNN
Another CNN I wrote. Classifies images as airplane or car.

# Prime Predictor
First ML project I did without a tutorial at hand. You provide the model an integer N, and it returns the Nth prime number using Random Forest Regression.

# Solomon
Nothing in here for now; this will eventually (hopefully) be a multi-module AI that will replicate my personality. Keeping it private for now.

# Titanic - Kaggle
My first Kaggle competition that I did horribly on. Still fun, and got me into competitions.
