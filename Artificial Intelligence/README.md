# CALIPSO Music Genre Classification
CALIPSO - "ClAssifier for Love In addition to Pirate Songs"

CALIPSO is an early project that I worked on, with the goal of classifying songs into one of two categories: "Love" and "Pirate". My band director once jokingly stated that every song fell into one of these categories, and the more I thought about it, the more it made sense. To streamline the classification process, I trained this model. 

# Genetic Programming
Very basic genetic stuff, I didn't enjoy the topic so I ceased progress on these

# INSERTER
My very first handwritten model. I used scikit-learn and the randomforestregressor to predict current solar irradiance based on temperature, humidity, time, etc. Very useful for knowing when to activate your solar panels. The models are too large to upload to Github, so here's a  GDrive link to my first 2: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xTrHogyQ2QVSlFasU4KyXLLxMtebyKvI. v1 takes into account wind direction and speed, which completely throw off the predictions. I recommend using v2, which doesn't have this issue.

Nothing in here for now; this will eventually (hopefully) be a multi-module AI that will replicate my personality. Keeping it private for now.
