# CALIPSO Music Genre Classification
CALIPSO - "ClAssifier for Love In addition to Pirate Songs"

CALIPSO is an early project that I worked on, with the goal of classifying songs into one of two categories: "Love" and "Pirate". My band director once jokingly stated that every song fell into one of these categories, and the more I thought about it, the more it made sense. To streamline the classification process, I trained this model.

Nothing in here for now; this will eventually (hopefully) be a multi-module AI that will replicate my personality. Keeping it private for now.
