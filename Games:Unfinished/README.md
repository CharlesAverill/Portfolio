# Caelum
A lot of the games here were built before I discovered Unity, so many of them stopped progression after I failed to develop a decent game engine. This is one of them, it was supposed to be a 2D Sidescroller.

# Desert Whale
Intended to be a top-down, procedural shoot-'em-up, using assets from Gun.Smoke, an NES favorite of mine.

# Hestia-New/Old
This one is a personal favorite, a top-down strategy game in which the player must grow a fire in the woods, while avoiding the park ranger, and making sure not to burn down the nearby city. I hope to recreate this in Unity one day, as I enjoy the concept a lot.

# Instant Monopoly
An instant Monopoly simulator. I didn't build this one, but made a few edits.

# Monopoly Probability Calculator
Abandoned and unfinished, the name says it all.
