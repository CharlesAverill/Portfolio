# Averill Conjecture
This is a proof I came up with in my sophomore year. If you split a cube down the center, and split its two halves, and so on, this program calculates the resultant surface area. I didn't publish it because it doesn't follow the general rule of, "If somebody can figure it out in a few minutes, it's not worth publishing." The concept seemed more complicated when I wrote this program, but I still find it interesting now.

# Bouncing Blocks
This one is a visualization of a theory that relates the momentums of two blocks with pi. There are two blocks, one is smaller and faster, and is in between a wall and the larger block. Depending on the ratio of the two masses, the number of collisions the smaller block makes with the wall and larger block will be roughly equal to pi, given that it is an ideal situation.

# Fractals
These are Mandelbrot and Julia fractal generators that I built for my computer science class. I understand they have something to do with complex numbers and chaos theory, however I never understood their applications.

# Game of Life
Conway's Game of Life. Nothing special, although I believe there are some issues with generational calculations, as some results don't add up like they should.

# Gravity
Gravity is one of my favorite concepts, so this 2D Newtonian gravity simulator was very fun to program. 

# Pendulum
Double and (broken) Triple pendulum simulators. These don't account for Energy, and frequently break physical laws. Very fun and relaxing to watch.

# Sierpinski Polygons
I built this around the same time I built the fractal programs. These draw Sierpinski polygons, which are shapes made up of individually plotted random points given N vertices. Generates a fractal as well. Very fun to watch.
