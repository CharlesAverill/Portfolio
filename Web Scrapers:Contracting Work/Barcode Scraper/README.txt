To use this scraper, Python 3.7 or greater must be installed.

Run the .py file, and scan your items with the barcode scanner plugged in.

When finished, type 'q' and enter your desired output filename.

The output file will be in .xlsx format.

If your columns read, "Log in to Your API Account", you are most likely scanning the wrong barcode on the item. If you are sure you're scanning the right barcode, the item will not be able to be scanned.
