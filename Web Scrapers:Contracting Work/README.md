# Barcode Scraper
This is a scraper I wrote for a friend that reads in a barcode and returns the name of the product and some other data. Didn't take too long, but was a fun and interesting project.

# CWS
This is the first web scraper I wrote. My client wanted to scrape the information of home contractors from around the country. I managed to scrape from Texas, West Virginia, and some other places, before the project lost funding and work was ceased. This project was an enormous learning experience for me, and was what made me realize that my future was in Computer Science.

# ExcelEmailMultipleChecker
A small utility I built for myself for other projects. Checks excel sheets for duplicate emails.

# FlipKart Scraper
A scraper I built for https://www.flipkart.com, collects info based on your search term and makes a CSV file with all search result information included. Another one of my early contracting jobs. Went without a hitch, works with little to no bugs, client was satisfied. 

# GOVSUDS
"GOVernment SUrplus Data Scraper". In August 2019 I began to look into government surplus sites, and it became a hobby to find the weirdest, cheapest things on various surplus auction sites. Eventually I decided to create a scraper that would search most major government surplus auction sites and summarize search results in a CSV. I only finished https://GovDeals.com before I lost interest, sadly. Might continue building this one later.

# HAR
Scraper for https://HAR.com, this is for real estate market analysis. One of my first Python scrapers. Pulls information about property and houses, exports it to CSV format.

# Science Bowl Bot
I recently joined my school's Science Bowl Team, however we have a hard time getting everybody to come to the meetings due to scheduling conflicts. So my friends and I set up a Discord server so we could do practice contests remotely. And in order to not have to banish somebody to the position of moderator during these practice competitions, we decided to write a Discord bot that would act as our moderator. My duty for the bot was to pull Science Bowl questions from the available list online and format them appropriately for the bot to interpret, because I already have extensive history with scraping. The project is almost complete, and while we may not get to utilize it to our fullest potential, we look forward to passing it on to our successors. This project was one of my first team projects.
