# Barcode Scraper
This is a scraper I wrote for a friend that reads in a barcode and returns the name of the product and some other data. Didn't take too long, but was a fun and interesting project.

# CWS
This is the first web scraper I wrote. My client wanted to scrape the information of home contractors from around the country. I managed to scrape from Texas, West Virginia, and some other places, before the project lost funding and work was ceased. This project was an enormous learning experience for me, and was what made me realize that my future was in Computer Science.

# ExcelEmailMultipleChecker
A small utility I built for myself for other projects. Checks excel sheets for duplicate emails.

# FlipKart Scraper
A scraper I built for https://www.flipkart.com, collects info based on your search term and makes a CSV file with all search result information included. Another one of my early contracting jobs. Went without a hitch, works with little to no bugs, client was satisfied. 

# GOVSUDS
"GOVernment SUrplus Data Scraper". In August 2019 I began to look into government surplus sites, and it became a hobby to find the weirdest, cheapest things on various surplus auction sites. Eventually I decided to create a scraper that would search most major government surplus auction sites and summarize search results in a CSV. I only finished https://GovDeals.com before I lost interest, sadly. Might continue building this one later.
