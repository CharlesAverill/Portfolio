Awesome
pros:good packaging and fast delivery,awesome graphics and gameplay,interesting features like changing jersey.
cons:u need to update the game to get few star players like kyrie irving,larry nance,etc....to change to their new teams.when u first start the game it will ask for your permission to update,u need to be connected to 2k server via wifi to paly my career story mode....
other than that u will enjoy the game thourougly..u need to have some knowledge about nba and players to play better.

Q:Which is better 2k17 or 2k18..??
A:2k18 is almost as same as 2k17. In my opinion, don't buy latest NBA games for old gen consoles and go for the old ones because they are much cheaper.
