Worth the money
Writing this review for the PS4 version.Pre-Ordered the game.But didnt receive the pre-order bonus.Now coming to the game.

Not recommended at all
Very bad attitude for delivery persons. Flipkart will never come near amazon. Even though repeated complaints were lodged. Same thing keeps happening. N no use writing reviews to u people. Keep trying n failing Flipkart.

Freaking awesome!
The best thing about FIFA 18 is it's gameplay, it's really awesome. Plus the seasons & Alex Hunter journey is exciting, & the season is different from the previous version because you get a real-time managerial role like the transfers you make you have to actually go & negotiate with managers, players & their agents, just go for this product, FIFA never disappoints!
