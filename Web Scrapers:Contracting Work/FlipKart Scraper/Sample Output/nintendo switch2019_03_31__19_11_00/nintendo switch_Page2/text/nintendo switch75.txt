Description
Hytech Plus presents the best carrying case available currently for Switch. Not only does the case look the best, it also offers the best protection for your favourite console. The solid build of the case will save your console from all bumps, drops and scratches that your console can be exposed to in day to day usage. With the 5 built-in game card holders, you will be able to carry your favourite games wherever you go. Space will never be a constraint and you can place the game boxes safely in your collection. This case supports the console with 2 Joy-cons installed on the side of the console. There is space for more Joy-cons in the large mesh pocket above where the console is placed. You need not remove the joy-cons each time you want to put the console in the box. Two straps hold the Switch and Joy-cons securely in the case. So not only does this case look the best, it also protects the best. HYTECH PLUS PRODUCTS ARE ONLY SOLD THROUGH HYTECH TRADING AND CLOUDTAIL. PLEASE DO NOT BUY FROM ANY OTHER SELLER.
