Best game ever made for ps4. In love with it again
The product reached a day earlier than promissed!
Packaging was great.
Original genuine product.
The game is awesome.
I feel like I am back in school days when I played this game on my ps1.
Nostalgia at its highest peak.
A must for those who have played this earlier on ps1.
Retailnet was my seller.
Thank You flipkart for an awesome online buying experience :)
